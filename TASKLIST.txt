API FIXING

- secret roll variations: 
    - <NPC name> rolls <attr+ability> (reveal broad-strokes result --- Messy Critical, Bestial Failure, Total Failure)
    - <NPC name> rolls <#> dice 
    - options to replace "NPC Name" with "Someone", to remove roll details, and to NOT show Messy Critical, Bestial Failure and Total Failure as results
- !daysleep, !startsession, !endsession
- D.Queue(function, [parameters]) --- adds to queue that is triggered when "!do next" chat command entered; reports when run and describes number of commands remaining
- move init and checkInstall functions to top of scripts
- very flexible method of applying bonuses and penalties to rolls based on "rolleffect" attribute on characters.
    - @{rolleffect} = "<flag OR trait>:<mod if applies>|<...>|<...>|<...>"
        - FLAGS: Apply a function to either RollData or RollResults.  Function accepts the rolleffect mod as an argument, and either rollData or rollResults.
                 Functions contained in a list in Roller.js
            e.g.    ROLLEFFECTS = {
                        HealthImpaired: (mod, rollData) => {
                            if (["Strength", "Dexterity", "Stamina"].includes(rollData.trait)) {
                                rollData.dicePool -= 2
                                rollData.negFlags.push("-2 (Injured)")
                            }
                        },
                        ForceNextMessyCrit: (, rollResults) => {
                            if (rollResults.outcome = MessyCrit) {
                                // set can't spend WP
                                // remove "ForceNextMessyCrit" flag from character
                            }
                        }
                    }
        - TRAIT: Applies modifier if trait is found in roll.
