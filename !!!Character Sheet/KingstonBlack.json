They separated when he was young and his mother ended up getting into a series of bad relationships that Kingston insists have nothing to do with the anger issues he feels. They might, they might not, it's unclear, but he does hate his mother more than basically any other person on the planet. She is a verbally abusive and mentally unstable person who should not have been allowed to raise kids. He has a half sister on his mothers side from an ill-advised relationship. She has since cleaned up and stopped drinking and doing drugs but is still impossible to deal with, passive-aggressive and verbally abusive all in one while constantly lamenting her lot in life as she heaps the abuse on you. It's all about respect with her despite her never showing any to anyone in return, and of course she constantly runs into drama in her own life despite wanting to \"avoid drama.\" Everyone on the planet is either the best person ever or a total bitch/asshole. \n\nHis father is a relatively calm man with strong political opinions in opposition to his own, although that is really their only point of conflict and strive now that Kingston has moved out of his place and is out of school. Before that point Kingston's habitual truancy was a major point of conflict and even ended up ruining one of Kingston's father's relationships. His father is still single to this day. Kingston now tries to support him in retirement and enjoys hanging out with him, watching MMA or Football and having some beer, or in Kingston's case, wine. They avoid political topics as best they can, but even if they do get into it they've learned to drop it quickly now. Often they end up in long conversations of a philosophical nature, which his father hates, a historical nature (especially about world war 1 and 2), which Kingston would enjoy more if only the topics were more varied so he didn't feel like a total idiot all the time, or about legal topics, usually the state of governance and laws in general as opposed to specific politicians, as that is considered safe territory. \n\nAll of Kingston's Grandparents except for his Grandmother on his mothers side have died of cancer, and his Aunt on his father's side almost did the same with breast cancer. He has three cousins, Brenna, Connor and Rick that he used to see a lot and get along with but for reasons he doesn't really understand they'd grown apart in the past several years before his embrace, and he hasn't really bothered to get back in touch. Kingston doesn't place a lot of value on familial loyalty and obligation just because they are family. There has to be something more to it for him, and as such he's always been closer to his father and friends than anyone else, and has never felt an urge to connect with any of his other relatives, especially his half-sister who he has mostly just abandoned to his abusive mother's care. He can't really tell you why he feels so jaded about the whole situation, but he does. If pressed he will admit that it does bother him when he thinks about it, but he thinks about it rarely and is easily able to distract himself from the topic before he feels any urge to do anything about it.\n\n Kingston actually went to the trouble of legally changing his last name from his mother's, Hamill, to his father's, Black. Not only does he think it's a much cooler name, but he generally only gets along with his father and wishes he could never have to interact with his mother again. Although he does like his Grandmother alright, so that's off the table. \n\nKingston's youth involved a lot of time not attending school in the early years because he would get into fights constantly. He was still relatively intelligent and was never held back for his performance, although he was never the student he could be, which was a perpetual source of disappointment for his family. He used to be a competent musician too, performing in one of the top high-school musical bands in his state, but he lost interest after he dropped out of school in favor of a GED and has never bothered to pick it back up. He did eventually go back and take upgrading courses at a local community college so he could have an official and full high school diploma, but that's about the extent of it. Mostly he's self-taught on a variety of topics, enjoying to read books and internet articles about anything that happens to catch his interest in the moment and generally pursuing them to a greater degree than most people do. \n\nAfter high school he didn't really do much different either. He did some drugs, he drank a little, and then he got a job in construction, using his father as an in. That's how he met Max, or more accurately, a ghouled friend of Max's who eventually introduced them. Cue a vitae addiction, missing work, disappointment from his father who then cuts him off, and a generally hellish lifestyle for a while until Max steps in as a surrogate figure rather than just a dealer, having seen something in the broken, or perhaps blank, slate that was now Kingston. He helped mold and model him for the embrace from that point, and Kingston really got his life back together, although he was angrier than ever and hoping to take it out *somewhere*. Cue the fight club as an operation for Max. Once Kingston was able to prove that was going well, the embrace was just a waiting game. ",
